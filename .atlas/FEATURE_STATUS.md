## Open Bugs — SP (B)

| ID | Issue |
|----|-------|
| B-9 | Conquest ships render as production bloom — new ships at conquered star spawn from center and spiral out over multiple ticks instead of appearing instantly. Root: `GameCanvas.svelte` lines 1412-1440 use identical spawn logic for production and conquest. Needs distinct conquest path. |
| B-24 | Erratic repair rates: user reports 200→120 damaged in single tick, rates varying 5-50%. Dataflow logging added to `applyRepair()` — console output shows star type, rate, typeMult, pinning, overflow. Investigate with StarInfoPanel + console. |
| B-25 | Lag when selecting enemy stars to issue deferred orders. User-reported, needs investigation. |
| B-26 | Game engine continues running after client dev server reloads (HMR). Console logs keep generating. `GameEngine.destroy()` may not be called on unmount. |

## Open Bugs — MP (B)

| ID | Issue |
|----|-------|
| B-23 | Play/pause outline not updating correctly (pending user verification) |

| B-16 | Lane passes under star | Phase 4: point-to-segment clearance filter (35px), client + server | re-fixed |
| B-26 | Star click targets wrong star on dense maps | `hitTestStar` finds nearest star, not first in array | `1fd62b6` |
| B-17 | Command arrows reach target | `ARROW_LENGTH_FRACTION` config + slider (default 50%) | `d38cdba` |
| B-13 | Spacebar doesn't work in MP | Routed spacebar through `activeGameStore` | `01a8b23` |
